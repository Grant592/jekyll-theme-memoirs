Hi, I’m Laura. I’m a 30-something Northern girl navigating life as a wife and Mammy while also running my own photography business.  My blog is my space for sharing places, recipes, outfits, stories and generally anything I find interesting.  I’m all about enjoying the simple things in life so I try to reflect that in the things I post. So grab a cup of something delicious, get comfy, have a read and enjoy x
