        <title>My Favourite Pumpkin Recipes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We are slap bang in the middle of pumpkin season and I absolutely love experimenting with various pumpkin recipes to really get me in the autumn mood.&lt;br /&gt;
Here is a list of some of my favourite pumpkin recipes for you to try on these cosy autumn days…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pumpkin-pancakes&quot;&gt;Pumpkin Pancakes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pumpkin_pancakes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These fluffy pumpkin pancakes are the ultimate autumn breakfast.  They go perfectly with crispy bacon, chopped pecans and a good drizzle of maple syrup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;300g plain flour&lt;br /&gt;
75g caster sugar&lt;br /&gt;
1 tbsp baking powder&lt;br /&gt;
½ tsp salt&lt;br /&gt;
1 tsp cinnamon&lt;br /&gt;
¼ tsp ground cloves&lt;br /&gt;
¼ tsp nutmeg &lt;br /&gt;
350ml milk&lt;br /&gt;
2 eggs&lt;br /&gt;
100g butter (melted)&lt;br /&gt;
1tsp vanilla &lt;br /&gt;
200g pumpkin puree&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, melted butter, vanilla and pumpkin until fully combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix into a smooth, thick batter. 
Heat a non-stick pan over a medium heat with a little oil.  Add a ladle of batter and cook until bubbles start to appear on the surface.  Flip the pancake and cook for a further 2 minutes (the pancake should start to puff up a little).  Once all of the mix is used up, stack the pancakes high and enjoy.  I like to top mine with grilled bacon, chopped pecans and a drizzle of maple syrup but whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon works well, too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pumpkin-pie&quot;&gt;Pumpkin Pie&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pumpkin_pie.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my ultimate favourite autumn treat.  I always look forward to the start of the season so I can start making pumpkin pie!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;350g shortcrust pastry &lt;br /&gt;
1 egg&lt;br /&gt;
425g can pumpkin puree&lt;br /&gt;
235ml evaporated milk&lt;br /&gt;
220g caster sugar&lt;br /&gt;
¼ tsp ground cloves&lt;br /&gt;
1 tsp salt&lt;br /&gt;
1 tsp ground cinnamon&lt;br /&gt;
½ ground ginger&lt;br /&gt;
1 tbsp plain flour&lt;br /&gt;
Whipped cream to serve&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preheat the oven to 170 
Dust a clean work surface with a little flour and roll out the pastry. Line a greased pie dish with the pastry and trim the edges with a sharp knife.&lt;br /&gt;
Put the egg, pumpkin puree, evaporated milk, sugar, cloves, salt, cinnamon, ginger and flour into a large bowl and mix until all of the ingredients are combined and the mixture is smooth.
Pour the mixture into the pie crust and bake for around 30 minutes or until the filling is firm and doesn’t wobble.  &lt;em&gt;I then switch the oven off, open the oven door a little and leave the pie in there while it starts to cool.  I find that doing this stops the filling from cracking as it cools because it is cooling more gradually than if I took it straight out of the oven.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After around 20 minutes, take the pie out of the oven and leave to cool completely.  Serve with a good dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pumpkin-loaf&quot;&gt;Pumpkin Loaf&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pumpkin_loaf.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works for breakfast, brunch or just as a snack.  I love it griddled and buttered so that it goes crispy on the outside and squidgy on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;300g plain flour&lt;br /&gt;
½ tsp salt&lt;br /&gt;
1 tsp baking soda&lt;br /&gt;
½ tsp baking powder&lt;br /&gt;
1 tsp ground cloves &lt;br /&gt;
1 tsp ground cinnamon &lt;br /&gt;
1 tsp ground nutmeg &lt;br /&gt;
170g unsalted butter (at room temperature)&lt;br /&gt;
400g caster sugar&lt;br /&gt;
2 large eggs&lt;br /&gt;
1 425g can pumpkin puree&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preheat the oven to 160º. Grease a loaf tin with butter and dust with flour.
In a medium bowl, add the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg and mix until well combined, set aside.
Using an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar on medium speed until just blended. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well. Continue beating until very light and fluffy, this should take 2 or 3 minutes. Add the pumpkin and continue to beat for one minute.
Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until combined.
Pour the batter into the loaf tin and bake for 1 hour and 15 mins or until a cake tester inserted into the centre comes out clean. Let the loaf cool in the tin for around 10 minutes before carefully turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
          I like to griddle slices of pumpkin loaf until they are slightly charred then eat them with butter on.  Delicious!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pumpkin-spiced-doughnut-holes&quot;&gt;Pumpkin Spiced Doughnut Holes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/doughnut_holes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be warned, once you have one, you will want more! These are a perfect little treat for a Halloween movie night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;225g plain flour&lt;br /&gt;
2 tsp baking powder&lt;br /&gt;
½ tsp salt&lt;br /&gt;
1 tsp cinnamon&lt;br /&gt;
¼ tsp ground cloves&lt;br /&gt;
½ tsp ground nutmeg&lt;br /&gt;
¾ can pumpkin puree&lt;br /&gt;
110g brown sugar&lt;br /&gt;
80ml vegetable oil&lt;br /&gt;
1 egg&lt;br /&gt;
1 tsp vanilla extract&lt;br /&gt;
120ml milk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sugar coating&lt;br /&gt;
110g unsalted butter, melted&lt;br /&gt;
130g granulated sugar&lt;br /&gt;
1 tbsp cinnamon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this recipe, I used a silicone cake pop mould, however, if you don’t have one of these you can also use a cupcake or mini cupcake tin. 
Preheat the oven to 170ºc and, if using a cupcake tin, generously grease the tin with butter.  In a large bow, mix together the flour, baking powder, salt, ground cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon.
In a separate bowl, mix together the pumpkin puree, brown sugar, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, egg and milk until smooth.
Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and stir in until everything is combined.  Be careful not to overmix.
Scoop the better into the cupcake tin (about ¾ full) or silicon mould and bake for around 10-12 minutes.
Remove the donuts from the oven and allow to cool a little, so that they are still warm but cool enough to handle.
In the meantime, place the melted butter in one bowl and the sugar and cinnamon in another.
Dip each donut hole into the butter then coat generously with the cinnamon sugar.&lt;br /&gt;
Serve warm!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Les Ambassadeurs, the first Restaurant we Visited in Paris</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Within the Hôtel de Crillon, which was built in 1758, Les Ambassadeurs operated as a restaurant since the mid-19th century. It reached its peak of fame as a restaurant and nightclub (a café-concert) in the last three decades of the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always a center of entertainment for the aristocracy, in the 1870s it also became a regular destination of some of the best known figures of art and the demi-monde. Edgar Degas and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec portrayed visitors at the night club, and Aristide Bruant performed there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was decorated in an 18th-century rococo style, redesigned by Sybille de Margérie with furnishings by Sonia Rykiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a renovation of the hotel in 1981–85, the restaurant occupied a former private ballroom with windows looking out on the Place de la Concorde, a few hundred meters from the Palais Garnier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Les Ambassadeurs had two Michelin stars. In the last decade of its operation, chef was Dominique Bouchet  followed by Jean-François Piège and finally when the hotel closed in 2013 for an extended renovation, Christopher Hache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017 Hache opened a smaller restaurant, L’Écrin, within the renovated hotel; the former space of Les Ambassadeurs became a bar.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Much more than a desert: A trip into the Sahara</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Sahara is a desert located on the African continent. It is the largest hot desert in the world, and the third largest desert overall after Antarctica and the Arctic. Its area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi) is comparable to the area of China or the United States.[3] The name ‘Sahara’ is derived from a dialectal Arabic word for “desert”, ṣaḥra (صحرا /ˈsˤaħra/).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desert comprises much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and Sudan. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the south, it is bounded by the Sahel, a belt of &lt;strong&gt;semi-arid tropical savanna&lt;/strong&gt; around the Niger River valley and the Sudan Region of Sub-Saharan Africa. The Sahara can be divided into several regions including: the western Sahara, the central Ahaggar Mountains, the Tibesti Mountains, the Aïr Mountains, the Ténéré desert, and the Libyan Desert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For several hundred thousand years, the Sahara has alternated between desert and savanna grassland in a 20,000 year cycle caused by the precession of the Earth’s axis as it rotates around the Sun, which changes the location of the North African Monsoon. The area is next expected to become green in about 15,000 years (17,000 AD).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>One day we just started our adventure</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>London is that kind of place you must visit in this lifetime</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Queen’s Guard and Queen’s Life Guard (called King’s Guard and King’s Life Guard when the reigning monarch is male) are the names given to contingents of infantry and cavalry soldiers charged with guarding the official royal residences in the United Kingdom. The British Army has regiments of both Horse Guards and Foot Guards predating the English Restoration (1660), and since the reign of King Charles II these regiments have been responsible for guarding the Sovereign’s palaces. The Guards are fully operational soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Queen’s Guard and Queen’s Life Guard are mounted at the royal residences that come under the operating area of the British Army’s London District, which is responsible for the administration of the Household Division. This covers Buckingham Palace, St James’s Palace and the Tower of London, as well as Windsor Castle. The Queen’s Guard is also mounted at the sovereign’s other official residence, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, but not as often as in London. In Edinburgh, the guard is the responsibility of the resident infantry battalion at Redford Barracks. It is not mounted at the Queen’s private residences at Sandringham or Balmoral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Queen’s Guard is the name given to the contingent of infantry responsible for guarding Buckingham Palace and St James’s Palace (including Clarence House) in London. The guard is made up of a company of soldiers from a single regiment, which is split in two, providing a detachment for Buckingham Palace and a detachment for St James’s Palace. Because the Sovereign’s official residence is still St James’s, the guard commander (called the captain of the guard) is based there, as are the regiment’s colours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Sovereign is in residence, the Queen’s Guard numbers three officers and forty other ranks, with four sentries each posted at Buckingham Palace (on the forecourt) and St James’s Palace (two in Friary Court, two at the entrance to Clarence House).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reduces to three officers and 31 ORs, with two sentries each, when the Sovereign is not in residence. The Queen’s Guard is not purely ceremonial in nature. They provide sentries during the day and night, and during the later hours, they patrol the grounds of the Palace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until 1959, the sentries at Buckingham Palace were stationed outside the fence. This stopped following an incident involving a female tourist and a Coldstream Guardsman – due to the continued pestering by tourists and sightseers, the guardsman kicked the tourist on the ankle as he marched. The tourist made a complaint to the police and the sentry was confined to barracks for ten days. Not long after, the sentries were moved inside the fence.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Memoirs supports external images as featured</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Adding images is a very annoying task, I know that, but “Memoirs” theme has external featured images integrated so your publishing task becomes easier now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spoliers Inside - a film review needs hidden spoilers like this post</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Director Roland Suso Richter’s enigmatic psychological thriller (direct to video/DVD) was based upon screenwriter Michael Cooney’s own play “Point of Death” - a title that gave away the film’s entire plot twist premise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in many similar films, such as Jacob’s Ladder (1990), Soul Survivors (2001), and The Butterfly Effect (2004), events and people were thoroughly distorted and confused because the protagonist was at the point of death. The tagline was misleading:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“When You Don’t Have a Memory, How Can You Remember Who to Trust?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mind-warping film opened with a hospital patient Simon Cable (Ryan Phillippe) awakening in a &lt;span class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt; hospital with little knowledge (amnesia perhaps?) of what had happened, and why he was there, etc. He was told by attending Dr. Jeremy Newman (Stephen Rea) that it was July 29, 2002 (Simon thought it was the year 2000 - he was confused - he heard a doctor say 20:00 hours!) and that he had died for two minutes from cardiac arrest following the near-fatal accident – but he had been revived (“You’re as good as new”).&lt;/span&gt; Dr. Newman: “Simon, this is the 29th of July. The year is 2002. And your wife, whose name is Anna, is waiting outside.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-critiques-say&quot;&gt;What critiques say?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There’s almost no single moment in Portrait of a Lady on Fire that couldn’t be captured, mounted, and hung on a wall as high art.” &lt;cite&gt;— Entertainment Weekly&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major clue to everything that truly happened was the scene that played next under the credits - hospital staff failed to bring a patient back to life with a defibrillator after a car accident. Chest compressions failed and there was no pulse. A second major clue was provided by hospital orderly Travis (Stephen Graham): Everybody dies. No mystery there. But why and how everyone dies. Now, there’s a mystery worth solving. Probably the biggest mystery there is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;so-how-do-we-add-spoilers-in-this-theme&quot;&gt;So how do we add spoilers in this theme?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&amp;gt;My hidden paragraph here.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;

        <title>French Wine has to compete with many new world wines</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;French wine is produced all throughout France, in quantities between 50 and 60 million hectolitres per year, or 7–8 billion bottles. France is one of the largest wine producers in the world, along with Italian, Spanish, and American wine-producing regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;French wine traces its history to the 6th century BC, with many of France’s regions dating their wine-making history to Roman times. The wines produced range from expensive wines sold internationally to modest wines usually only seen within France such as the Margnat wines were during the post war period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two concepts central to the better French wines are the notion of terroir, which links the style of the wines to the locations where the grapes are grown and the wine is made and the Appellation d’origine contrôlée (AOC) system, replaced by the Appellation d’Origin Protégée (AOP) system in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appellation rules closely define which grape varieties and winemaking practices are approved for classification in each of France’s several hundred geographically defined appellations, which can cover regions, villages or vineyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France is the source of many grape varieties (such as &lt;strong&gt;Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Sauvignon blanc, Syrah&lt;/strong&gt;) that are now planted throughout the world, as well as wine-making practices and styles of wine that have been adopted in other producing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some producers have benefited in recent years from rising prices and increased demand for some of the prestige wines from Burgundy and Bordeaux, the French wine industry has seen a decline in domestic consumption and internationally, it has had to compete with many new world wines.&lt;/p&gt;
