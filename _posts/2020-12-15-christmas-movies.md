We all have our essential Christmas movies that we have to watch every year: It's a Wonderful Life, Santa Caus the Movie, The Holiday, Love Actually, Elf, the list goes on.  
But, if you’re like me and can’t resist a good, cheesy, holiday romance movie, these are just some of the titles I would highly recommend you watch on these cold, December nights!  

## Christmas Around The Corner

One for all you Virgin River fans. Alexandra Breckenridge plays a New York venture capitalist who escapes to a cute little town for Christmas only to discover that festivities have been cancelled due to flood damage around the town.  While staying in the quaint little apartment above the local bookstore she gets to know the owners and decides to help them revitalize the store and bring Christmas back to the entire town.  I love this one because not only am I a big Alexandra Breckenridge fan, I also love the cosy bookstore feels and the fact that this is not actually too cheesy for a cheesy Christmas movie.  

## The Christmas Secret

I discovered this movie a few years ago and now it is a must-watch every Christmas.  You will notice a bit of a recurring theme of OTH stars on this list.  This one sees Bethany Joy Lenz as a single Mum, down on her luck, trying to make ends meet in the run-up to Christmas.  As luck would have it she gets a job at a cute little bakery and catches the eye of a handsome mystery man who might just end her run of bad luck.  But I won’t spoil the ending for you! 


## Snowed Inn Christmas

Another Bethany Joy Lenz movie, this time it is the story of two rival big city writers ending up in a festive little town right before Christmas and finding that they actually have more in common than they think.  They discover that the quaint little Inn they are stranded in is actually at risk of being closed so they decide to write a story about it in the hopes of saving it for the, very familiar, owners.  I think what I love most about this one is the Inn and how festive it looks.  It’s exactly the kind of place I would want to stay for my Christmas holidays. 



## The Christmas Contract

I just watched this one for the first time but thought it was definitely worth mentioning.  This one is kind of like a One Tree Hill reunion, so good news if you’re an OTH fan.  Jolie (played by Hilarie Burton) is dreading going home for the holidays as she will have to face her ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend, so she is set up with her best friend’s brother so she can pretend she, too is in a relationship.
  
## Christmas Getaway

This is not a particularly well-known movie but it’s one that I discovered last year and really enjoyed. A travel writer books a Christmas holiday to try and help her get inspired for a story, but finds herself double-booked with a widower, his mother, and his young daughter in a cosy Christmas cabin.  She grows close to the family as they tick off a festive to-do list together. This one definitely gives a lot of inspiration for things to do over the Christmas holidays to get you into the spirit of things. 

## Christmas Comes Twice

Emily has achieved all of her career goals but can’t help thinking about George, the love that got away five years earlier. When the Christmas carnival comes to town, a ride around the carousel takes her magically back in time to the carnival five years before and gives her a second chance at love before she must return to Christmas present.

## Mrs Miracle

Possibly my favourite Christmas movie.  I always watch this one at least once every Christmas.  James Van Der Beek stars as Seth, a widower with two young sons who enlists the help of a Nanny who, unbeknown to him, has magical powers and helps him find love again in the form of Reba (played by Erin Karpluk, of Being Erica fame).
  

## The Christmas Train

My hubby told me I had to include this one, and I will admit, I did quite enjoy it.  A cynical journalist decides to take a train all the way from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles for Christmas to get inspiration for a story in honour of his late father. Along the way, he gets to know the other, sometimes quite eccentric passengers and runs into an old flame while on board.
